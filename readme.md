Requirements:

**User Interface:**
Create a responsive and user-friendly interface for browsing products and managing the shopping cart.
Include the following features:
Product listing page with pagination or infinite scroll to handle large datasets.

A cart page showing added products, quantities, and total cost with options to update or remove items.
Allow users to filter and sort products by category, price, or rating.
**Data Management:**
Simulate a backend API (you can use mock data or a simple JSON file) to fetch product data and cart details.
Implement a local database (e.g., Room, Realm) to store cart items and sync with the API for a seamless user experience.
Code Quality:
Follow best practices for Android development (MVVM architecture preferred).
Ensure your code is modular, well-organized, and includes comments where necessary.
Implement unit tests for critical functionalities, such as cart operations.
**Performance Optimization:**
Ensure smooth scrolling and quick load times when browsing products.
Implement lazy loading for images and optimize network calls.
**Documentation:**
Create a README file that includes:
An overview of your app.
Instructions for running the app.
Design choices and rationale behind your architecture.
Challenges faced during development and how you overcame them.
**Optional Enhancements:**
Implement user authentication (e.g., sign up/sign in).
Include a wishlist feature for saving favorite products.
